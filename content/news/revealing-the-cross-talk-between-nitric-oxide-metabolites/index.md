summary: Nitric oxide (NO•) is an endogenously produced diatomic radical that regulates fundamental biological functions. Although NO• is a free radical, its reactivity in biological media is selective toward other radicals and transition metal centers. NO• metabolites include S-nitroso thiols (RSNOs), nitrite, peroxynitrite, nitrosylated heme proteins, and dinitrosyl-iron complexes (DNICs).
